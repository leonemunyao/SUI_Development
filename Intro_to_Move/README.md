Introduction to DeFi and Dex

DeFi lets rugular folks do financial stuff directly with each other. There are no middle men involved, just peer to peer power. 

How does Defi Work?

It operates on the blockchain technology ensuring secure and immutable transactions through digital blocks.
It bypasses traditional intermediaries like banks, offering low fees and higher interest rates by facilitating peer to peeer transacttions. 
We have DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing and trading making financial interactions accesible to all. 
Leveraging blockchain, DeFi transcends geographical barriers allowing seamless financial interactions worldwide.

Goals of DeFi.... They include accessibility(anyone with internet connection can interact with DeFi protocal), security and transparency, autonomy(It doesn't need large banks. It doesn't need for central control.)

DeFi on SUI. 

Leverages a novel concencus mechanism for efficient and stable transactions, catering for simple and complex DeFi operations. 
Implement parallel execution to execute transactions simultaneously, eliminating delays and ensuring smmooth DeFi interactions.
Introduces storage fund tokenomics, revolutionazing blockchain storage costs and maintaining fair fees, thus creating a well organzed digital ecosystem of DeFi. 


What is a Decentralized exchange?(DEX)

DEX is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that opearates without a centralized authority or intermediary. DEX's uses smart contracts or other decentralized procols to enable peer to peer trading directly between us. 

Advs of DEX 

Security -  users retain control of their private keys and funds.
Privacy - users can trade directly with one another without the need for intermediaries
Cencorship Resistance
Interoperability.

Here the main aim is building a DeepBook. A decentralized exchange(DEX) protocol that enables the exchange of assets within the SUI ecosystem.
